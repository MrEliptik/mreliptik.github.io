A course focused on making everything juicy in a game using a breakout clone as a base game (project provided, we won't recreate the game in the course) . Weâ€™ll go over everything needed to bring the game from boring to awesome using many technique such as:

- Animations (easing, bezier curves)
- Lerp (linear interpolation)
- Tween

- Trails
- Particles
- Camera shake & movement
