<p>Hi, I'm Victor, a full time indie game developer!</p>

<p>I've been using <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> 2019 and I released my first game Dashpong in October, 2022.</p>

<p>I do YouTube videos about gamedev and games I create on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrEliptik">this channel</a> and I also have  dedicated to Godot.</p>

<p>Before Godot, I was a software engineer! I graduated with an embedded software degree in 2019.</p>

<h2>Work with me</h2>
